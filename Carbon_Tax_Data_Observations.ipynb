    "Methodology: We will look at price trends in grocery costs throughout the year with a focus on the transition between first to second quarter (the tax season). Our approach will be mostly concerned with animal products that have a large carbon footprint. We are also interested in how the Carbon Tax affects other food products, say those that involve heavy transportation costs; Like Seafood. \n"
