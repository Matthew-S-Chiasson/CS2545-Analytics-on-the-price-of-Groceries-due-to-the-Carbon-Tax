Our approach will be mostly concerned with animal products that have a large carbon footprint. We are also interested in how the Carbon Tax affects other food products, say those that involve heavy transportation costs; Like Seafood. \n"

    "# Introduction\n",
    " Our project aims to analyze the price trends on grocery items and its root cause, with a heavy emphasis on the relevance of Carbon Tax onto the Canadian economy. We hypothesize that since the introduction of the Carbon Tax on a federal level in 2019 (some provinces have had Carbon Tax since 2016 [1]), grocery prices have been steadily rising due to fuel consumption and a rising population; Paired with the Covid-19 pandemic, prices of groceries have since been increased to new heights and have not been decreasing gradually as much as its causes have been increasing. \n",

    "(talk about seasonal production and despite how thats a thing other non-agricultural items still increased in price)"
